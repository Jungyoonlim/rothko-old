Artificial Intelligence and Art, Man and Machine, Tragedy and Ecstasy

## What Rothko does: AI Art and Design Studio
 - Start: Automating UV unwrapping for 3D modeling (in interior design, games, 3d art, ar/vr etc)

### UV-ing

### art + design easily 
- Idea: say a website. I just want to choose certain font and choose where to put and design things based on some concept. < how can wordpress not solve this problem? > well, it's just really limited and would need some 
- a program that reads codes and tells you which part of the physical product works. and could change just based on plain english. website is one good example. machine <> human translation and humans could directly alter the code in plain english. like where is this button placed in the code? and how could i move it little bit to the right? then shows me which snippet of the code determines that and how i could alter the code. not just a website but other digital things that require coding 
- like, bring in some images and mix and blend style and such and save a lot of time even for beginners. and show humans where in the code they can make changes
