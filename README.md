# What Rothko does: AI Art and Design Studio
- Project #1:  Automate UV unwrapping for 3D modeling (in interior design, games, 3d art, ar/vr, architecture, engineering, product design etc)
#### Moving Project 2 and 3 to different repos
- Project #2: Unsupervised Learning x Art. Algorithms find patterns beyond human labels -- that was not thought possible. Exploring the gaps between language. 
- Project #3 (TBD): AI x Style. What is it to create your 'style'?

## What is UV-ing?
- ML Algorithms can have an advantage by training on a wide variety of complex geometries, e.g. dealing with non-planar or concave polygons, quite common in 3D models. 

## timeline
- early Jul: Ideation, talking to designers 
- Jul 17-21: search+download data!
- Jul 22: unzip, convert, parse
- Jul 23: Try turbosquid to download only the ones with UV maps / alter the src codes for that!
- Jul 24: Turbosquid 
- Jul 25-Aug 1: Data cleaning, data augmentation, data preprocessing for Project #1, Data preparation (Moma's Collection) for Project #2
- Need to learn more about GANs. Will document on my blog. 
- Trying Reinforcement Learning instead of CNNs for UV unwrapping.
