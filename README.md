# What Rothko does: AI Art and Design Studio
- Project #1:  Automate UV unwrapping for 3D modeling (in interior design, games, 3d art, ar/vr, architecture, engineering, product design etc)
- Project #2: Unsupervised Learning (K-Clustering) x Art. 

### What is UV-ing?
- ML Algorithms can have an advantage by training on a wide variety of complex geometries, e.g. dealing with non-planar or concave polygons, quite common in 3D models.
