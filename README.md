# What Rothko does: AI Art and Design Studio
- Project #1:  Automate UV unwrapping for 3D modeling (in interior design, games, 3d art, ar/vr, architecture, engineering, product design etc)
- Project #2: Unsupervised Learning x Art. Exploring the bounds of creativity and the human mind. Unlabelled data to see the gaps of human perception.
- Project #3 (TBD): AI x Style. What is it to create your 'style'?

### What is UV-ing?
- ML Algorithms can have an advantage by training on a wide variety of complex geometries, e.g. dealing with non-planar or concave polygons, quite common in 3D models. 

### timeline
- early Jul: Ideation, talking to designers 
- Jul 17-21: search+download data!
- Jul 22: unzip, convert, parse
- Jul 23: Try turbosquid to download only the ones with UV maps / alter the src codes for that!
- Jul 24: Turbosquid 
- Jul 25-Aug 1: Data cleaning, data augmentation, data preprocessing for Project #1, Data preparation (Moma's Collection) for Project #2
